# Vanilla javascript shopping list and a shopping cart

A single page application in Javascript for a new online supermarket "FicticiousMarket" which offers it's users to order their groceries online.

Their requirements were:

* the shopping list data is provided over this API: https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/code-challenge-shopping-cart/cart.json
* there should be a search field (search for title only) above the item list, that updates the item list responsively
* on the same page (either next to it on the right or below the shopping list in a fixed container) there should be an overview over the current cart with: the amount of products you put in the cart, by product - as well as the total price
* items should be able to be removed from the cart individually
* an option to sort the articles ascending by price
